# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Data set used in this assignment is taken from this website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
In this repo there is an R script, that loads all necessary data from a chosen directory and does all requested transformation to obtain a tidy data.
